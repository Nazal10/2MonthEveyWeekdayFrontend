        If you need more about me, I have been actively involved in the IT field for the past three years, 
        striving to enhance my skills and knowledge. Prior to this, 
        I completed degrees in Public Science and Political Administration. 
        Over the years, I have earned multiple certifications 
        through various bootcamps and software development courses, 
        reflecting my commitment to continuous learning. Currently, 
        I am enrolled in a Frontend Development course, 
        which I believe will help me address my gaps in this area 
        and further strengthen my expertise.</span>
